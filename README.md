We are proud to present our first X7 community tool! 
Welcome to:
 [https://X7community.space/](https://x7community.space/)
A dashboard that shows all of your X7 holdings and displays the overall $ or ETH value,
aswell as overall supply percentage across each token in the ecosystem. 
The DApp also contains following features:
- Swap feature via Uniswap DEX
- New ecosystem overview 
- Link portal
- Information on main X7 contracts and wallets
The DApp will be up-to-date and updated along with new released information and/ or changes within the ecosystem. 
We thank @WoxieX, one of our dedicated community members, 
for taking the lead and putting in hard work and effort to provide us this tool. 
From the community, for the community!
Trust no one. Trust code. Long live DeFi.
